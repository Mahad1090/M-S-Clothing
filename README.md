This is a front-end clothing website project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created collaboratively by Shayan and Mahad during our first semester as an introduction to web development. The website features a responsive layout, a homepage with product listings, and a fully functional shopping cart system powered by JavaScript, allowing users to add and remove items dynamically. The project helped us understand the fundamentals of front-end design, DOM manipulation, user interaction, and teamwork. It was built completely from scratch without any external libraries or frameworks and serves as a foundation for our journey into modern web development. No setup is required â€” simply download or clone the repository and open STARTING PAGE.html in your browser to view it.
